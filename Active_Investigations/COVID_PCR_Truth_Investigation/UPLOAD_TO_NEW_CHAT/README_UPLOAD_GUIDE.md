## 📊 INVESTIGATION STATUS

**Studies Analyzed:** 6 major papers
**Date Range:** 2020-2023 (evidence was EARLY)
**Sources:** The Lancet (2x), PHE UK, Qatar Ministry, Germany RKI, Jefferson/Cochrane
**Cross-Validation:** PERFECT across all studies
**Smoking Gun:** Germany data suppression documented

**Key Finding:**
Government institutions had comprehensive evidence that PCR CT values matter and 
RNA ≠ infectiousness by November 2020, but binary PCR testing without CT context 
continued as standard practice.

## 📋 WHAT TO SAY IN NEW CHAT

"I'm continuing a COVID-19 PCR testing truth investigation. I've analyzed 6 major 
studies (2020-2023) showing PCR CT values matter and RNA detection ≠ infectiousness.

Evidence includes:
- Lancet systematic review (79 studies): No viable virus beyond day 9
- Multiple government agencies (UK PHE, Qatar, Germany) HAD the data
- Germany RKI suppressed serology data that contradicted PCR policy
- The Lancet explicitly stated 'RNA detection cannot be used to infer infectiousness' (Nov 2020)

Binary PCR without CT context continued despite clear scientific evidence.

I'm uploading 5 core analysis files. We're at evidence-gathering phase with more 
papers to analyze, then synthesis and comprehensive report.

Continue using Truth-Seeking Methodology: primary sources, evidence matrices, 
active disconfirmation, brutal clarity."
