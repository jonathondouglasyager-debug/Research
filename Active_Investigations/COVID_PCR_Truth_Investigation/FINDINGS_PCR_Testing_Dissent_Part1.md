# COVID-19 PCR Testing Dissent Investigation  
## Evidence-Based Findings on Professional Consequences and Censorship

**Investigation Date:** December 17, 2024  
**Methodology:** Truth-Seeking - Primary sources, documented evidence, active disconfirmation  
**Scope:** International, 2020-2024, all professional consequences related to PCR testing critique

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Research Question:** Did scientists, doctors, or researchers face professional consequences or censorship specifically for raising concerns about PCR testing limitations (Ct values, RNA vs infectiousness, false positives)?

**Primary Finding:** The scientific debate about PCR testing limitations occurred **openly in peer-reviewed literature** throughout 2020-2023. Major journals including The Lancet, Eurosurveillance, Clinical Infectious Diseases, and others published studies documenting Ct value correlations with infectivity, RNA shedding duration vs viable virus, and false positive concerns.

**Key Evidence:**
- ✅ Lancet Microbe published systematic review (79 studies) stating "RNA detection cannot be used to infer infectiousness" (November 2020)
- ✅ Public Health England published Ct value correlation study (August 2020)
- ✅ CDC, WHO, FDA, PHE all issued guidance acknowledging PCR limitations
- ✅ Qatar Ministry of Public Health implemented Ct-based policy and published validation study

**Censorship Pattern:** Limited documented cases of censorship **specifically** for PCR testing critique. Most individuals who faced consequences made claims **beyond** PCR testing accuracy (vaccine misinformation, conspiracy theories, professional misconduct).

**Documented Case:** Dr. Clare Craig (UK diagnostic pathologist) - clearest example of censorship specifically related to PCR testing concerns.
