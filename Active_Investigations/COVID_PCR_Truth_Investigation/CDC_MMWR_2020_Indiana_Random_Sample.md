## Study Overview
- **Study Type:** Statewide random sample prevalence study
- **Sample Size:** 3,658 participants (23.6% response rate from 15,495 selected)
- **Date:** April 25-29, 2020
- **Population:** Indiana (6.73 million residents)
- **Method:** RT-PCR + IgG antibody testing

## CRITICAL FINDINGS

### 1. Confirmed Cases vs. Actual Infections
**BOMBSHELL:**
> "By late April, an estimated **187,802 Indiana residents were currently or previously infected** with SARS-CoV-2 from the start of the pandemic through April 29, 2020"
> 
> "In late April, a total of **17,792 COVID-19 cases had been confirmed** using conventional testing strategies"
> 
> **"The number of reported cases represents only a fraction of the estimated total number of infections."**

**KEY METRIC:**
- **Confirmed cases:** 17,792
- **Actual infections (estimated):** 187,802
- **Ratio:** Confirmed cases represented only **1 in 9.6 infections** (9.6x undercount)

### 2. Asymptomatic Infections
**CRITICAL FINDING:**
> "Among persons with active infection, **44% reported no symptoms** during the 2 weeks before testing."

**Quote from CDC:**
> "Among all participants with positive RT-PCR results, **44.2% reported no symptoms** during the 2 weeks before testing."

### 3. Population Prevalence
- **Active infection (RT-PCR positive):** 1.74% (95% CI: 1.10-2.54%)
- **Past infection (IgG positive):** 1.09% (95% CI: 0.76-1.45%)
- **Overall prevalence:** 2.79% (95% CI: 2.02-3.70%)

### 4. Infection Fatality Rate
- **Deaths:** 1,099
- **Estimated total infections:** 187,802
- **Infection-fatality rate:** 0.58%
- **Comparison to influenza:** ~6 times higher than flu (0.1%)

## Public Health Implications

### Testing Bias Acknowledged
**CDC's own words:**
> "Because racial and ethnic minority populations responded at lower rates in the sample... civic leaders were enlisted to establish 2 days of **nonrandom testing**"

**Bias in nonrandom samples:**
> "Because some participants in the nonrandom testing group might have chosen to participate because of concerns that they might be infected, **possibly resulting in selection bias**; findings from the nonrandom testing are reported separately."

### Policy Context
> "**Policymakers need to have generalizable population estimates** of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence to establish baseline prevalence rates and to understand the groups most at risk for infection."

## Limitations Acknowledged by CDC

### Five Key Limitations
1. **Low response rate (23.6%)** - although adjusted for nonresponse
2. **Test limitations** - RT-PCR positive percent agreement was 90% for one test
3. **Self-selection bias** in nonrandom sample
4. **Single point in time** - not generalizable to other states/times
5. **Excluded populations** - those without tax returns, institutionalized, children <12

## Nonrandom Sample Comparison
**Demonstrates selection bias:**
- Random sample active infection rate: 1.74%
- Nonrandom sample active infection rate: 22.8%
- **13x higher in self-selected sample**

**Asymptomatic rates also different:**
- Random sample: 44.2% asymptomatic
- Nonrandom sample: 20.2% asymptomatic

**CDC's conclusion:**
> "Because of the higher prevalence and smaller percentage of asymptomatic persons in the nonrandom sample, those estimates (and **estimates from nonrandom samples from other states**) might be subject to **selection bias** and are therefore **not as representative** as are estimates from random samples."

## Relevance to PCR Investigation

### 1. Case Count Accuracy
This CDC study proves that **symptom-based testing massively undercounted actual infections** - by nearly 10-fold.

### 2. Asymptomatic Transmission
44% of PCR-positive people had NO symptoms - confirming asymptomatic spread.

### 3. Testing Strategy Bias
CDC explicitly acknowledged that **nonrandom sampling produces biased results** - yet most testing was symptom-based (nonrandom).

### 4. Policy Implications
> "The number of reported cases represents only a fraction of the estimated total number of infections."

This undermines any policy based on "case counts" since they represented only ~10% of actual infections.

## Key Quotes for Investigation

**On hidden infections:**
> "The number of reported cases represents an estimated **one of 10 infections**."

**On asymptomatic spread:**
> "Among persons with active infection, **44% reported no symptoms** during the 2 weeks before testing."

**On testing bias:**
> "Estimates from nonrandom samples from other states might be subject to **selection bias** and are therefore **not as representative** as are estimates from random samples."

**On policy needs:**
> "Policymakers need to have **generalizable population estimates** of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence"

## Category
- **Population Surveillance**
- **Testing Bias**
- **Asymptomatic Transmission**
- **Case Count Accuracy**

## Evidence Type
- **Source:** CDC MMWR (authoritative government publication)
- **Quality:** High (random sample, 3,658 participants)
- **Relevance:** CRITICAL - demonstrates 10-fold undercount of infections

---
**Saved:** December 17, 2025
**Critical Insight:** CDC's own study showed that **confirmed cases represented only 1 in 10 actual infections** and that **44% of infected people had no symptoms**. This demolishes the reliability of symptom-based testing strategies and "case count" metrics for policy decisions.
