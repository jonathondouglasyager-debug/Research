# Dan et al. (2021) - Immunological Memory Study
**Citation:** Dan JM, Mateus J, Kato Y, et al. Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for up to 8 months after infection. Science. 2021 Feb 5;371(6529):eabf4063. doi: 10.1126/science.abf4063

## Study Overview
- **Study Type:** Longitudinal cohort study
- **Sample Size:** 188 COVID-19 cases, 254 samples total
- **Duration:** Up to 8 months post-infection
- **Focus:** Immune memory (B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells)

## Key Findings
- Immune memory detectable in >90% of subjects for >5 months
- High heterogeneity in magnitude of adaptive immune responses
- Durable immunity against secondary COVID-19 is possible for most individuals

## Relevance to PCR Investigation
This study's methodology notes are relevant to understanding PCR testing context:

**From Methods:**
> "For asymptomatic subjects, the day from first positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR-based testing was used in place of the date of first reported COVID-19 symptoms."

**Key Point:** Even in immune response research, PCR positivity was used as a proxy for infection timing in asymptomatic cases - highlighting how PCR results were used for clinical decision-making despite limitations in determining infectiousness.

## Category
- **Primary Focus:** Immunology/Immune Response
- **Secondary Relevance:** PCR as diagnostic tool for case definition

## Notes
This study demonstrates how PCR testing became the standard for case identification and timing, even in research contexts where the limitations (detecting RNA vs. infectious virus) could affect interpretation of "infection date" especially in asymptomatic individuals.
