# PCR Testing Investigation - Executive Brief
## December 17, 2024

### THE BOTTOM LINE
RT-PCR tests detect genetic material (RNA fragments), **not infectious virus**. High cycle threshold values (Ct > 30) consistently showed no live virus in culture, yet many "positive" results were reported at Ct 35-40.

### THE KEY NUMBERS
- **Ct > 30:** Associated with non-infectious samples
- **Day 8:** Infectivity declines after this point, even with high viral loads  
- **27.9 days:** Mean duration of PCR positivity
- **7.3 days:** Mean duration of actual infectious virus
- **33% reduction:** In odds of live virus for every 1-unit Ct increase

### THE CRITICAL PROBLEM
> "A binary Yes/No approach to the interpretation RT-PCR unvalidated against viral culture will result in false positives with possible segregation of large numbers of people who are no longer infectious and hence not a threat to public health."

### WHAT THIS MEANS
People were:
- Quarantined based on non-infectious RNA fragments
- Counted as "cases" when not contagious
- Kept out of work for weeks after infectious period ended
- Contact traced when no transmission risk existed

### THE SOURCE
**Study:** "Viral cultures for COVID-19 infectivity assessment – a systematic review (Update 4)"  
**Authors:** Jefferson T, Spencer EA, Brassey J, Heneghan C  
**Published:** September 29, 2020 (medRxiv preprint)  
**Evidence:** 29 studies analyzed  
**DOI:** 10.1101/2020.08.04.20167932v4

### NEXT INVESTIGATION STEPS
1. ✅ Document limitations of PCR testing
2. ⏳ Determine which authorities knew about these limitations
3. ⏳ Analyze why findings weren't implemented in policy
4. ⏳ Calculate human/economic cost of ignoring this research
5. ⏳ Investigate German-specific PCR accuracy studies
6. ⏳ Track institutional response and media coverage
