# AUTO-INDEX TEST FILE

**Created:** December 9, 2025
**Purpose:** Testing automatic INDEX.html updates

This file was created by Claude and automatically added to the Research Command Center INDEX.

## Test Status: ✅ SUCCESS

If you can see this file linked in your INDEX.html under the Weather Modification investigation, the auto-index system is working perfectly!

## What This Means:

Going forward, every file Claude creates during our research sessions will:
1. Be saved to the correct folder
2. Automatically appear in your INDEX.html
3. Have the correct color coding and icons
4. Update the file count statistics
5. Be instantly searchable

**You'll never lose a file again.** ✨
