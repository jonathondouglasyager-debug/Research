# Fox Corporation: Comprehensive Corporate Investigation and Media Control Analysis

**Investigation Date:** December 10, 2025

**Bottom Line Up Front:** Fox Corporation operates as a media empire effectively controlled by Lachlan Murdoch through a dual-class share structure that gives the Murdoch family **36.2% voting control** despite minority economic ownership. The September 2025 family settlement secured Lachlan's sole control through 2050, paying out $3.3 billion to his siblings. Fox News remains the dominant force in cable news (**23 consecutive years at #1**), generating **$16.3 billion in FY2025 revenue** despite paying the largest media defamation settlement in U.S. history ($787.5 million to Dominion). The most significant verified defense/tech connection is a direct commercial partnership with **Palantir Technologies** for AI newsroom tools.

## 1. MONEY: Financial architecture of media control

### Ownership structure and voting control

The Murdoch family maintains control through a **dual-class share system**. Class B shares (235.6 million outstanding) carry full voting rights, while Class A shares (209.9 million outstanding) vote only on limited matters like mergers. The Murdoch Family Trust holds approximately **36.2% of Class B shares**, enabling control of board elections and strategic decisions with minority economic ownership.

**September 2025 family settlement** restructured control permanently. Lachlan Murdoch gained sole voting authority through a new trust (LGC Holdco) extending through 2050. His siblings James, Elisabeth, and Prudence each received approximately **$1.1 billion** from the sale of 16.9 million Class B shares to exit the trust entirely. Grace and Chloe Murdoch remain as economic beneficiaries under Lachlan's control.

Major institutional shareholders include **Vanguard (7.49%)**, **BlackRock (5.7-15.1%)**, **State Street (4.59%)**, and **Dodge & Cox (3.1%)**. These same institutions hold positions across defense contractors and other sectors, creating indirect but standard market connections.

### Revenue streams and financial performance

Fox Corporation reported record **FY2025 revenue of $16.3 billion**, up 17% year-over-year. Revenue breaks down as:

| Source | FY2025 Amount | % of Total |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Affiliate fees | $7.66 billion | 47% |
| Advertising | $6.87 billion | 42% |
| Other | $1.78 billion | 11% |

By segment, Television generated **$9.33 billion** while Cable Network Programming (Fox News, Fox Business, Fox Sports) contributed **$6.93 billion**. Tubi streaming exceeded **$1.1 billion in revenue** with 100+ million monthly active users.

Fox News charges cable providers approximately **$2.18 per subscriber monthly**—significantly higher than CNN (~$1) or MSNBC—and is seeking increases to $3+. With approximately 61.9 million multichannel subscribers, affiliate fees alone generate over **$1.3 billion annually** from Fox News Channel.

### Major financial transactions

The defining transaction was the **March 2019 Disney acquisition** of 21st Century Fox assets for $71.3 billion. Disney acquired the film studios, FX networks, National Geographic, and international properties. Fox Corporation retained Fox News, Fox Broadcasting, Fox Sports, and television stations—the assets most valuable to Murdoch's influence. Sky plc was sold separately to Comcast for approximately **$15 billion**.

Since the spin-off, Fox has returned **$6.4 billion to shareholders** through buybacks and authorized an additional $5 billion in August 2025. The company maintains **$5.4 billion in cash** against $7.2 billion in debt.

### Executive compensation

**Lachlan Murdoch** received **$33 million** in FY2025 total compensation ($3M base salary, $10.6M stock awards, $10.7M performance bonus). Rupert Murdoch as Chairman Emeritus earned approximately **$21.2 million** in FY2024. Other executives include CFO Steve Tomsic (~$1.75M base) and COO John Nallen (~$2M base).

## 2. HIERARCHIES: Concentrated power in Murdoch hands

### Board composition and independence

Fox Corporation's seven-member board includes six nominally independent directors plus Lachlan Murdoch:

| Director | Role | Background |
|----------|------|------------|
| Lachlan Murdoch | Executive Chair/CEO | Family-affiliated |
| Chase Carey | Lead Independent | Former Formula 1 Chairman |
| Paul Ryan | Governance Chair | Former House Speaker |
| Roland Hernandez | Audit Chair | Former Telemundo CEO |
| William Burck | Compensation Chair | Former White House Counsel |
| Tony Abbott | Director | Former Australian PM |
| Peggy Johnson | Director | Former Magic Leap CEO; **BlackRock board member** |

**Rupert Murdoch** retains Chairman Emeritus status since November 2023, maintaining advisory influence without formal voting power. Reports indicate he still speaks daily with Lachlan.

### Fox News Media leadership chain

Editorial control flows through a tight hierarchy. **Suzanne Scott** serves as CEO of Fox News Media since May 2018—the first woman in that role—reporting directly to Lachlan Murdoch. **Jay Wallace** as President and Executive Editor oversees all news programming and editorial decisions across Fox News, Fox Business, and digital properties. **Tom Lowell** handles day-to-day editorial management as Senior EVP and Managing Editor.

The Dominion lawsuit discovery revealed this structure in action: internal communications showed executives and Rupert Murdoch directly influencing coverage decisions, with Scott writing during election coverage that fact-checking "has to stop now. The audience is furious and we are just feeding them material. Bad for business."

### Leadership transition timeline

Roger Ailes founded Fox News in October 1996 under Rupert Murdoch's direction, building it into the dominant cable news network by 2002. His July 2016 resignation amid sexual harassment allegations from Gretchen Carlson and others marked the end of an era. Suzanne Scott's May 2018 promotion formalized the post-Ailes structure. **Tucker Carlson's April 24, 2023 termination**—decided personally by Lachlan Murdoch and Suzanne Scott—came one week after the Dominion settlement, reportedly influenced by internal messages revealed during discovery.

## 3. SOURCES: Revenue and content pipelines

### Primary funding sources

Fox News derives approximately **47% of revenue from affiliate fees** paid by cable providers regardless of individual household viewership. The remaining revenue comes from advertising (**42%**) across multiple categories. **Pharmaceutical companies** represent an outsized presence—GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, and others collectively ran thousands of ads since 2019, reportedly comprising approximately 75% of evening news advertising according to some estimates.

Other major advertisers include Liberty Mutual, Progressive, Verizon, NewDay USA, and Charles Schwab. Following the 2024 election, major brands including Netflix, Amazon, J.P. Morgan, and Lowe's increased Fox News spending. Despite periodic boycott campaigns, Fox reported "all-time record" advertising revenue for FY ending June 2024.

**MyPillow** was a major advertiser spending approximately $50 million in 2020, though the relationship has been turbulent—ads were briefly suspended in January 2024 over approximately $7.8 million in unpaid bills.

### Content origin points

Fox News uses standard wire services (AP, Reuters) for breaking news content while producing most programming in-house at its New York headquarters (1211 Avenue of the Americas). The company operates 29 owned television stations in 18 markets, providing local news content. Fox Nation (subscription streaming) and Tubi (free ad-supported) extend digital distribution.

Fox News maintains bureaus in Washington D.C. and operates correspondents internationally, though the network's emphasis on opinion programming distinguishes it from traditional news operations. The separation between "news" shows (Special Report) and "opinion" shows (Hannity, The Ingraham Angle) remains a formal distinction, though critics and internal documents suggest the boundary is often blurred.

## 4. CONTEXT: Market dominance and legal exposure

### Competitive position

Fox News has maintained cable news dominance for **23 consecutive years** and **94 consecutive quarters**. 2024 metrics showed Fox capturing **56% of primetime cable news audience** and **53% of total day**—topping CNN and MSNBC combined.

| Network | Primetime Avg. (2024) | Total Day Avg. |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| Fox News | 2.38 million | 1.50 million |
| MSNBC | 1.20 million | 791,000 |
| CNN | 685,000 | 481,000 |

Post-2024 election, Fox's dominance intensified: primetime reached 72% of cable news viewership while MSNBC lost 57% and CNN lost 49% of their audiences. **The Five** averages 3.4-3.8 million viewers; **Gutfeld!** leads late-night across all networks in the 25-54 demo.

**Newsmax** and **OAN** compete from the right but haven't meaningfully challenged Fox's position. Newsmax's March 2025 IPO saw shares surge 700%, though daily viewership (150,000-400,000) remains a fraction of Fox's millions. OAN lost major distribution when DirecTV and Verizon dropped the network in 2022.

### Regulatory environment

The FCC regulates broadcast stations, not cable networks—meaning **Fox News Channel itself operates without an FCC broadcast license**. This distinction protected Fox when the Media and Democracy Project filed a July 2023 petition to deny WTXF-TV (Fox 29 Philadelphia) license renewal based on Dominion lawsuit revelations. FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel dismissed the petition in January 2025, noting the cable network was the lawsuit's subject, not the broadcast station.

Fox faced more aggressive UK regulation. Ofcom found multiple Fox News violations of the UK Broadcasting Code, contributing to Fox News being pulled from UK air in August 2017 (ostensibly for commercial reasons). The Competition and Markets Authority investigated Fox's Sky bid on media plurality grounds before Comcast ultimately won the acquisition.

### Legal exposure landscape

The **Dominion Voting Systems settlement of $787.5 million** (April 18, 2023) stands as the largest known media defamation settlement in U.S. history. Discovery revealed internal communications showing hosts and executives knew election fraud claims were false—Tucker Carlson texted "I hate him [Trump] passionately" and called Sidney Powell's claims not credible; Rupert Murdoch acknowledged Trump's voter fraud claims were "really crazy stuff."

**Smartmatic's $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit** remains active after New York appellate courts rejected Fox's dismissal attempts in January 2025. The case subpoenaed four Fox board members in June 2024. Smartmatic received $25 million from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman to sustain the litigation.

Sexual harassment settlements totaled tens of millions: **$20 million** to Gretchen Carlson, **$13 million** to Bill O'Reilly accusers, **$40 million** severance to Roger Ailes upon resignation. A 2017 shareholder derivative suit settled for **$90 million** (paid by insurers).

## 5. DOCUMENTS: Evidence and primary sources

### Key SEC filings

Fox Corporation files with the SEC under CIK **0001754301**. Essential documents include:

- **Form 10-K** (Annual Report): Details financial performance, risk factors, and business operations
- **DEF 14A** (Proxy Statement): Lists board members, executive compensation, ownership structure
- **Form 8-K**: Material event disclosures including the Dominion settlement
- **Schedule 13D/13G**: Institutional ownership filings

Access via SEC EDGAR: https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001754301

### Court documents

Dominion maintains a comprehensive document archive at https://www.dominionvoting.com/legal-updates-learn-how-we-are-defending-dominion/ including:
- Summary Judgment decision (March 31, 2023)
- Dominion's Summary Judgment Brief with exhibits (February 16, 2023)
- Over 700 discovery exhibits
- Partial deposition transcripts of Rupert Murdoch, Lachlan Murdoch, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity

The Nevada probate proceedings regarding Murdoch family trust amendments remain sealed, though the 96-page December 2024 ruling by Commissioner Edmund Gorman—characterizing Rupert and Lachlan's effort as a "carefully crafted charade" conducted in "bad faith"—was reported by multiple outlets.

## 6. CONNECTIONS: Verified relationship networks

### Direct commercial partnership: Palantir Technologies

The most significant verified defense/tech connection is Fox News Media's **partnership with Palantir Technologies**, disclosed in November 2025. Palantir engineers have been embedded in Fox's digital newsroom for approximately one year, building AI tools including:

- "Topic Radar" - custom briefings for reporters
- "Text Editor" - style and link evaluation
- "Article Insights" - article performance analysis

The deal is structured to prevent Palantir (and other AI partners including OpenAI) from training on Fox News content. This represents a direct vendor relationship with a company that derives substantial revenue from U.S. defense and intelligence agencies.

### Board member connections

**Peggy Johnson** (Fox board member since November 2023) serves on **BlackRock's Board of Directors**. She also began her career at General Electric's Military Electronics Division. This creates an indirect connection to defense sector financing given BlackRock's holdings across defense contractors.

No current Fox Corporation directors hold board positions at major defense contractors (Raytheon/RTX, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics).

### On-air contributors with defense ties

Fox News employs military analysts with undisclosed defense industry connections:

- **Jack Keane** (Senior Strategic Analyst): Partner at SCP Partners (defense-focused venture capital); past connections to General Dynamics and Blackwater
- **Van Hipp** (American Defense International): Lobbies for Raytheon, Palantir, and General Atomics; published on FoxNews.com

These represent individual rather than corporate relationships.

### Institutional investor overlap

Vanguard, BlackRock, and State Street hold significant positions in both Fox Corporation and major defense contractors—a standard pattern across virtually all large publicly traded companies that does not indicate special relationships.

## KEY FINDINGS: Executive summary

**Control Architecture:** The Murdoch family's dual-class share structure represents a textbook case of maintaining control with minority economic ownership. The September 2025 settlement permanently secured conservative editorial direction by removing James Murdoch (who advocated reforms) from influence while extending Lachlan's control through 2050.

**Financial Resilience:** Despite paying the largest media defamation settlement in history, Fox Corporation reported record FY2025 results. The company's affiliate fee model provides stable revenue regardless of individual household viewership, while advertising has proven remarkably resistant to boycott campaigns.

**Legal Exposure:** The $2.7 billion Smartmatic lawsuit represents ongoing existential risk. Discovery may reveal additional damaging internal communications. Multiple shareholder derivative suits seek recovery of the $787.5 million Dominion payment from directors.

**Defense/Tech Nexus:** The Palantir partnership confirms a direct commercial relationship with a major government contractor. While structured for commercial AI applications, this represents the clearest verified defense/surveillance sector connection. Individual contributors' undisclosed defense industry ties raise editorial independence questions without constituting corporate relationships.

**Market Position:** Fox News's dominance shows no signs of weakening. The network commands pricing power with cable providers and maintains audience loyalty despite controversies, suggesting the business model remains highly defensible absent regulatory intervention—which is limited by FCC's lack of jurisdiction over cable networks.

**Verification Note:** All major claims in this report derive from SEC filings, court documents, official corporate disclosures, and established news sources. Primary source links for SEC filings are available at SEC EDGAR (CIK 0001754301). Dominion case documents are accessible at dominionvoting.com/legal-updates. Cross-referenced claims about defense connections distinguish between direct relationships (Palantir partnership) and indirect connections (shared institutional investors).
