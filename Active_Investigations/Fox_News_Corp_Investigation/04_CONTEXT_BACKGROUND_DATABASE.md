## 💰 MEDIA INDUSTRY ECONOMICS CONTEXT

- Wall Street Journal
- New York Post

- HarperCollins Publishers
- Dow Jones & Company
- Australian newspapers
- **Control Structure:** Same Murdoch Family Trust, same 36.2% voting control

- Typically right-leaning editorial positions (not uniform)
- Vertically integrated (print, broadcast, digital)
- **Family Dynamic:** Succession planning decades-long issue
  - Inspiration for HBO's "Succession" (loosely)

## 🎬 CONTENT & ENTERTAINMENT CONTEXT

### Fox Entertainment Strategy
- **Historic Strength:** Young, diverse audience vs. other broadcast networks

## 🌐 INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON CONTEXT

**U.S. vs. Other Democracies:**

- **UK Model:** Ofcom regulates broadcast content, "due impartiality" requirements
  - Sky News (formerly Murdoch-owned) subject to UK rules
- **Australia Model:** Australian Communications and Media Authority oversight
- **Canada Model:** CRTC has content/balance requirements

**Result:** Fox News business model would not work in most other democracies due to content regulations.
