## 🔍 HIERARCHY INVESTIGATION NOTES

### Control Mechanisms to Map:
1. ✅ Murdoch Family Trust voting structure
2. ✅ Board committee authorities
3. ✅ C-suite reporting lines
4. ✅ Division leadership
5. ⏳ Detailed org charts by division
6. ⏳ Editorial approval chain at Fox News
7. ⏳ Government relations approval process specifics

### Questions for Further Investigation:
1. What decisions require board approval vs. CEO authority alone?
2. How much practical power do independent directors have vs. Murdoch control?
3. What's the actual influence chain from contributors (Keane, Hipp) to editorial decisions?
4. How are editorial decisions about controversial content actually made?
5. What's the relationship between FOXPAC and Government Relations office?
6. Who at Fox has direct White House/Congressional access?
7. What's the relationship between board members (Ryan, Burck) and political activities?

### Red Flags for Further Examination:
- 🚩 Undisclosed conflicts: Military analysts with defense industry ties
- 🚩 Board composition: Former government officials (Ryan, Burck, Abbott)
- 🚩 Dual-class shares: Murdoch family 36.2% voting control despite lower equity stake
- 🚩 Editorial-commercial tension: Advertisers vs. content decisions
- 🚩 Post-Dominion changes: What shifted in editorial approval chains?
