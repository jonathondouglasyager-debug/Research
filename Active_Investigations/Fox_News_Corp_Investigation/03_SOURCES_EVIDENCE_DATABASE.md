### Source Hierarchy (Truth-Seeking Methodology)
1. **Tier 1 (Highest):** Federal legal filings (SEC, FEC, Court records)
   - Criminal penalties for fraud
   - Third-party auditing
   - Public accountability

2. **Tier 2 (High):** Corporate direct disclosures reviewed by board
   - Political Activities Reports
   - Proxy statements
   - 10-K risk factors

3. **Tier 3 (Medium-High):** Sworn testimony / Depositions
   - Court proceedings
   - Congressional testimony
   - Under penalty of perjury

4. **Tier 4 (Medium):** Corporate PR / Investor Relations
   - Press releases
   - Earnings calls
   - Self-promotional; verify material claims

5. **Tier 5 (Variable):** News reporting
   - Quality varies by outlet and reporter
   - Check reporter's track record

### Red Flags for Source Skepticism:
- 🚩 "According to sources familiar with..."
- 🚩 Competitor reporting on competitor

- 🚩 Passive voice hiding attribution ("It is believed that...")
- 🚩 Round numbers without source ($5 billion, $10 million, etc.)
- 🚩 Conflicting reports without explanation

### Verification Checklist:
- [ ] Can I access the primary document?
- [ ] Does the secondary source quote accurately?
- [ ] Are numbers exactly matching primary source?
- [ ] Is context provided or cherry-picked?
- [ ] Who benefits from this narrative?
- [ ] What's the counter-evidence?
