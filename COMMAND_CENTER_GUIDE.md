## WORKFLOWS

### Daily Research Workflow:

1. **Open Command Center** (from bookmark)
2. **Check stats** (see current state)
3. **Use Quick Actions** to jump to your work
4. **Add notes** to investigations as you work
5. **Search** when you need to find something specific

### Starting New Investigation:

1. Create folder in `Active_Investigations\`
2. Add files to the folder
3. Click **🔄 Refresh Index** in Command Center
4. Investigation won't appear automatically (file is static)
5. You'd need to manually add the investigation to the HTML (or rebuild)

**OR** better: Just use File Explorer and your Master Research Hub for now. This INDEX is your navigation/overview tool.

### Finding Files Fast:

1. Open Command Center
2. Type search term (e.g., "database")
3. Click matching link
4. File/folder opens

### Comparing Investigations:

1. Use search to find related items across investigations
2. Example: Search "database" shows all 8 databases
3. Click to open multiple databases for comparison

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Links Don't Work
**Problem:** Click a link, nothing happens
**Solution:**
- Make sure file paths are correct
- File may have moved - check `C:\Users\jonat\Documents\Research\`
- Some browsers block file:/// links - try different browser

### Notes Don't Save
**Problem:** Notes disappear after closing browser
**Solution:**
- Notes are saved in browser's localStorage
- If you clear browser data, notes are deleted
- Use Chrome/Edge for best compatibility
- Don't use Incognito/Private mode

### Search Doesn't Find Everything
**Problem:** Search misses files you know exist
**Solution:**
- Search only looks at visible text and keywords
- File content isn't searched (only names)
- Use File Explorer search for deep file content search

### Page Looks Weird
**Problem:** Formatting is broken
**Solution:**
- Press `Ctrl+F5` to hard refresh
- Try different browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled

---

## MAINTENANCE

### Weekly:
- **Add notes** to investigations as you work
- **Check stats** to see growth

### Monthly:
- **Review notes** on each investigation
- **Move completed work** to Archive
- **Update status badges** if needed (requires editing HTML)

### Quarterly:
- **Backup Research folder** to external drive
- **Review file organization**
- **Clean up old development versions** (v1-v5) once you're confident in production version

---

## FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

### Things You Can Add Later (Requires Editing HTML):

1. **Auto-Refresh Functionality**
   - JavaScript that scans Research folder

```

**Why:** If you customize it, you don't want to lose your work

**How:** 
- Copy to external drive monthly
- Or use cloud storage (OneDrive, Google Drive)
- Keep v1-v5 as backups

### Recovery:
If INDEX.html gets corrupted:
1. Copy `INDEX_v5.html` to `INDEX.html`
2. Or restore from backup
3. Or ask Claude to rebuild it (we have the structure)

---

## CUSTOMIZATION IDEAS

### Easy Customizations (No coding):
1. **Bookmark location** - Put it in bookmarks bar
2. **Browser** - Use your preferred browser
3. **Zoom level** - Adjust for comfort
4. **Window size** - Make it full screen or half screen

### Medium Customizations (Basic HTML editing):
1. **Change colors** - Edit the CSS color codes
2. **Add investigations** - Copy/paste investigation blocks
3. **Update file links** - Change href values
4. **Modify badges** - Change text/colors
5. **Update stats** - Edit the numbers

### Advanced Customizations (Requires coding):
1. **Add new features** - JavaScript functionality
2. **Dynamic file detection** - Auto-scan folders
3. **Database integration** - Connect to external databases
4. **API connections** - Pull data from web services
5. **Real-time updates** - Auto-refresh when files change

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING SPECIFIC ISSUES

### Issue: File paths don't work on different computer
**Solution:** 
- File paths are absolute (C:\Users\jonat...)
- If you move Research folder, paths break
- Solution: Edit all file:/// paths in HTML
- Or use relative paths (requires rebuilding)

### Issue: Notes disappeared
**Check:**
1. Same browser? (Chrome vs Firefox have separate storage)
2. Same user account?
3. Did you clear browser data?
4. Are you in Incognito mode?

**Recovery:** Notes are permanent loss if storage cleared

### Issue: New files don't show up
**Explanation:** 
- INDEX.html is static (doesn't auto-update)
- You must manually add new files to the HTML
- Or click Refresh button (just reloads the page, doesn't add files)

**Solutions:**
1. Manually edit HTML to add new files
2. Use File Explorer to access new files
3. Ask Claude to rebuild the INDEX with new files

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Can I access this from my phone?**
A: Not easily - file:/// protocol doesn't work well on mobile. You'd need to host it on a web server.

**Q: Can multiple people use this?**
A: Each person needs their own copy with correct file paths. Notes are per-browser, not shared.

**Q: Does this replace my Master Research Hub?**
A: No - they're complementary. This is for navigation/overview, Hub is for analysis/processing.

**Q: Can I change the colors?**
A: Yes - edit the CSS color codes in the <style> section. Hex codes like #4a9eff.

**Q: What if I add a new investigation?**
A: You'd need to edit the HTML to add it, or ask Claude to rebuild the INDEX.

**Q: Can this track file changes?**
A: Not automatically. It's a static index. You'd need to add JavaScript for dynamic tracking.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: 100% - everything is local. No internet, no tracking, no data sent anywhere.

**Q: Can I print this?**
A: Yes (Ctrl+P) but it's designed for screen use. Consider exporting to PDF instead.
