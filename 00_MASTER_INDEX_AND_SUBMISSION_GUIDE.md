## ⏱️ EXPECTED TIMELINE

**Initial Response:** 20 business days (acknowledgment required by law)  
**Full Response:** 30-90 days (best case) to 6-12 months (typical)  
**Possible Outcomes:**
- ✅ Full grant - data provided
- ⚠️ Partial grant - some data withheld, explanation provided
- ❌ Full denial - must provide exemption justification
- 🔄 "No records exist" - Follow up asking WHY (this is critical data)

---

## 📊 TRACKING YOUR REQUESTS

Create a spreadsheet to track:
1. Agency name
2. Submission date
3. Confirmation received (Y/N)
4. FOIA request number assigned
5. Expected response date (20 days from submission)
6. Actual response date
7. Outcome (granted/partial/denied/no records)
8. Follow-up actions needed

---

## 🎯 WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

### **Scenario 1: Data Exists and Is Released** ✅
- Analyze data for natural vs. anomalous signatures
- Compare with Hurricane Maria and other storms
- Update evidence matrix
- Revise assessment based on findings

### **Scenario 2: Data Exists But Is Withheld** ⚠️
- Note specific exemptions claimed
- Appeal if exemptions seem inappropriate
- Document pattern of selective withholding
- Revise investigation accordingly

### **Scenario 3: "No Records Exist"** 🚨
- **CRITICAL FINDING** - This is the smoking gun
- Follow up asking WHY no data exists when:
  - Monitoring systems were operational
  - Maria and medicanes have published data
  - This is standard practice for major hurricanes
- Document systematic gap in routine monitoring

---

## 🔄 FOLLOW-UP STRATEGY

**If no response after 20 days:**
- Send polite follow-up email referencing original request
- Ask for status update
- Reference statutory timeline

**If "no records" response:**
- Submit follow-up request asking:
  - Were monitoring systems operational?
  - Why no data collected when routine for other storms?
  - Any technical failures or budget issues preventing collection?
  - Documentation of decision not to monitor

**If partial grant:**
- Review exemptions carefully
- Consider appeal if exemptions seem inappropriate
- Document what was withheld and why

---

## 📝 IMPORTANT LEGAL NOTES

1. **Fee waivers:** All requests include fee waiver language - you should NOT be charged
2. **Expedited processing:** All requests include expedited processing - cite 200+ deaths, public interest
3. **Appeal rights:** If denied, you have right to appeal within agency
4. **FOIA vs. Public Records:** HAARP request uses Alaska law, not federal FOIA
5. **No commercial use:** Do NOT use data commercially or fee waivers will be denied

---

## 🔍 AFTER RECEIVING DATA

1. **Verify completeness:** Check against what was requested
2. **Document format:** Ensure usable formats (NetCDF, HDF, CSV, etc.)
3. **Quality check:** Verify metadata and calibration information included
4. **Compare with precedent:** How does this compare to Maria data?
5. **Update investigation:** Revise Phase 4 analysis based on findings
6. **Share findings:** Make results publicly available (required for fee waiver)

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

**DO:**
✅ Use dedicated research email
✅ Submit in priority order (Tier 1 first)
✅ Keep copies of everything
✅ Track all submissions in spreadsheet
✅ Follow up politely but persistently
✅ Be prepared for 6-12 month timeline

**DON'T:**
❌ Rush - review each letter before sending
❌ Send all at once - stagger by week/tier
❌ Use personal email - creates chaos
❌ Give up if slow - government timelines are long
❌ Make accusations - keep tone professional and scientific

---

## 💡 FINAL TIPS

1. **Check spam folders** - Government emails sometimes filtered
2. **Save all correspondence** - Build complete paper trail
3. **Be patient** - FOIA takes time, especially for scientific data
4. **Stay professional** - Even if frustrated, maintain courteous tone
5. **Update investigation** - Revise findings as data comes in
6. **Share results** - Public interest requires public access to findings

---

## 📞 QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS?

If you encounter issues:
- Check agency FOIA FAQ pages
- Call FOIA offices directly (most have phone numbers)
- Consult FOIA.gov for general guidance
- Document all issues for potential appeals

---

**Remember:** This is a systematic investigation. Whether data exists or doesn't, whether it's released or withheld - ALL outcomes provide information. The investigation adapts based on evidence, not predetermined conclusions.

*"We only seek truth, we only tell truth"*
