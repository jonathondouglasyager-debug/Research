## TRUTH-SEEKING METHODOLOGY NOTES

### What We Know with High Confidence:
1. These documents were filed in federal court in SDNY
2. The case was assigned case number 1:16-cv-04642-RA
3. The case was voluntarily dismissed and refiled
4. Attorney Thomas Francis Meagher represented plaintiff
5. Allegations were made under oath via declaration

### What Requires Further Verification:
1. Tiffany Doe's complete testimony (Document 1-2)
2. Status of refiled case 1:16-cv-07673-RA
3. Any responses filed by defendants (none found before dismissal)
4. Whether any discovery occurred
5. Identity/status of "Maria" referenced in declaration

### Questions for Investigation:
1. Why was the case voluntarily dismissed on Sept 16, 2016?
2. What happened with the refiled case 1:16-cv-07673-RA?
3. Were the defendants ever served with the complaint?
4. Did plaintiff receive threats as claimed in paragraph 11 of declaration?
5. Was there any police investigation into the "Maria" reference?

## DISCONFIRMATION ATTEMPTS

**Potential Weaknesses to Investigate:**
- Case was dismissed before any defendants filed responses
- No judicial determination of facts occurred
- Allegations remain unproven in court
- Voluntary dismissal could indicate various reasons (threats, lack of evidence, settlement, strategic refiling, etc.)

**Counter-Evidence Sought:**
- Defendant responses (none filed before dismissal)
- Court orders on motions (initial conference only scheduled)
- Independent corroboration of allegations
- Timeline inconsistencies

**Status:** No counter-evidence located in initial investigation as case dismissed before adversarial proceedings

---

## LEGAL ANALYSIS NOTES

### Jurisdictional Basis
- **Diversity Jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1332)**
  - Plaintiff: California citizen
  - Defendants: New York citizens
  - Amount: >$75,000
  - ✅ PROPER if facts as alleged

### Choice of Law
- New York Penal Law cited for statutory violations
- New York tort law for civil claims
- ✅ APPROPRIATE for events alleged to occur in Manhattan

### Statute of Limitations Issue
- Allegations from 1994, filed in 2016 (22-year gap)
- **Duress** claimed as tolling mechanism
- NY law on SOL for childhood sexual abuse would be relevant
- ⚠️ This could have been contested by defendants

### Anonymity
- Properly supported by Second Circuit precedent
- Sensitive nature + threat of harm = strong grounds
- ✅ LIKELY WOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED
