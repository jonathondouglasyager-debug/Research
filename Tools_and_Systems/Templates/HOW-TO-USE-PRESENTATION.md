## How to Record Your First Video

### Option 1: Screen Recording (Simplest)

1. **Open the PowerPoint** in present mode
2. **Install OBS Studio** (free) if you don't have it
3. **Set up OBS:**
   - Add "Window Capture" source
   - Select your PowerPoint window
   - Add "Audio Input Capture" for your microphone
4. **Record:**
   - Hit "Start Recording" in OBS
   - Present through the slides while narrating
   - Use your research doc as script guide
   - Hit "Stop Recording" when done
5. **Done** - Upload the video file to YouTube

### Option 2: With Edits (Better Quality)

1. **Record voiceover separately** (cleaner audio)
2. **Screen record the presentation** advancing through slides
3. **Use DaVinci Resolve** (free) to:
   - Import video and audio
   - Sync them up
   - Trim any mistakes
   - Export final video

## What to Say (Script Framework)

Use your research document as the script. For each slide:

**Slide 1:** "Operation Popeye. Weather Modification in Vietnam. This is the declassified truth."

**Slide 2:** "Between 1967 and 1972, the United States military weaponized weather..." [expand with details from research doc]

**Continue through each slide**, letting the visuals support your narration.

## Slide 9 - Adding Your Research

This slide is a placeholder for YOUR databases. To add them:

1. Take screenshots of:
   - Your 30-state legislation map
   - Your 300-year timeline
   - Your infrastructure actor database
2. Insert these images into Slide 9
3. Replace the placeholder text with captions for your visuals

OR: Screen-record yourself navigating your actual databases and splice that footage into your video during editing.

## Key Points for Narration

✅ **DO:**
- Speak conversationally (like explaining to your wife)
- Pause between major points
- Emphasize the primary source citations
- Show the documents on screen
- End with questions, not conclusions

❌ **DON'T:**
- Rush through slides
- Read bullet points word-for-word
- Claim things beyond what documents show
- Apologize or seem uncertain
- Over-explain (trust the visuals)

## Next Steps After This Video

1. **Upload to YouTube** (unlisted or public - your choice)
2. **Get feedback** from people you trust
3. **Iterate** - improve based on what works/doesn't
4. **Part 2:** Deep dive into current weather mod operations using your databases

## Tips for Camera Comfort (Future)

Since you mentioned wanting to eventually be on camera:

- Start off-camera with voiceover (this presentation)
- Graduate to picture-in-picture (small webcam corner)
- Eventually full talking head when comfortable
- The research quality matters more than production value at first

## Technical Notes

- **Slide dimensions:** 16:9 (standard YouTube format)
- **Design:** Minimal black/white/gray (Ian Carroll style)
- **Fonts:** Arial (universally compatible)
- **All sources cited** in footnotes on each slide

You're ready to record. The pregame is solid.
