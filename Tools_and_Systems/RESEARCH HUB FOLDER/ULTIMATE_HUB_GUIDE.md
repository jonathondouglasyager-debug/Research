## 💡 FILE PROCESSING EXAMPLES

### **Example 1: PDF Government Document**

**You drop:** `DOD_Weather_Contract.pdf` (47 pages, scanned)

**System does:**
```
1. Loads PDF ✓
2. Extracts text from all 47 pages ✓
3. Runs OCR on scanned pages ✓
4. Finds entities (Raytheon, NOAA, etc.) ✓
5. Extracts dates (1996, 2024, etc.) ✓
6. Tells Claude what was found ✓
```

**Claude says:**
> "I just processed a PDF: 'DOD_Weather_Contract.pdf'. Here's a summary:
>
> Entities found: Raytheon, NOAA, Defense Department, Weather Service...
>
> Dates: 2024, 2023, 1996...
>
> What insights can you provide?"

**Claude's analysis:**
> "This document appears to be a government contract for weather research. 
> Key players: NOAA (primary agency), Raytheon (contractor). Multiple references 
> to 1996 suggest connection to the 'Owning Weather 2025' doctrine. Would you 
> like me to cross-reference this with your existing databases?"

**You respond:** "Yes, cross-reference!"

**Claude:**
> "Checking your loaded databases... I see you have Atmospheric_Infrastructure_Actors 
> loaded. Raytheon appears 28 times in the contract and is in your Actors database 
> with a 2017 NOAA contract worth $269M. This appears to be a continuation of that 
> relationship. The 1996 dates align with the Air Force white paper timeline."

**🔥 This is the power of integration.**

### **Example 2: CSV Database**

**You drop:** `Geoengineering_Legislation.csv`

**System does:**
```
1. Parses CSV ✓
2. Loads 26 rows ✓
3. Creates database "Geoengineering_Legislation" ✓
4. Tells Claude columns and record count ✓
```

**Claude says:**
> "I just loaded a CSV database: 'Geoengineering_Legislation' with 26 records. 
> The columns are: State, Bill_Number, Status, Year, Primary_Sponsor, Party, 
> Penalties, Scope. Ready to query!"

**You ask:** "Which states have enacted bills?"

**Claude searches your data:**
> "Based on the loaded database, two states have enacted bills:
> 1. Tennessee - HB2063/SB2691 (enacted April 11, 2024)
> 2. Florida - SB56 (enacted June 2025)
>
> Both are Republican-sponsored with Class E felony penalties. Want details?"

### **Example 3: Scanned Image**

**You drop:** `handwritten_notes.jpg`

**System does:**
```
1. Loads image ✓
2. Runs Tesseract OCR ✓
3. Extracts text ✓
4. Sends to Claude ✓
```

**Claude says:**
> "I just processed an image via OCR: 'handwritten_notes.jpg'. Here's the 
> extracted text: [shows extracted text]. Would you like me to analyze this?"

## 🔥 POWER WORKFLOWS

### **Workflow 1: Complete Document Investigation**

```
1. Drop PDF: government_contract.pdf
   → Auto-extracts entities, dates

2. Claude analyzes: "Found Raytheon 28x, NOAA 34x"

3. You ask: "Cross-reference with my data"

4. Claude: "Raytheon in Actors DB, $269M NOAA contract"

5. You: "Show me the timeline"

6. Claude: "2017 initial contract, this 2024 renewal"

7. You: "Export this as evidence"

8. Claude: "Here's a summary for your truth-telling..."
```

**Result:** Complete investigation in minutes, not hours.

### **Workflow 2: Multi-Source Synthesis**

```
1. Drop 3 PDFs: contract1.pdf, contract2.pdf, contract3.pdf
   → Each auto-processes

2. Drop 2 CSVs: actors.csv, timeline.csv
   → Instant databases

3. Ask Claude: "What's the common thread?"

4. Claude analyzes all 5 sources simultaneously

5. Claude: "Raytheon appears in all 3 contracts, your Actors 
   DB shows $500M+ total contracts, Timeline shows 2017-2025 
   span. Pattern: sustained government funding for weather 
   research through single contractor."

6. You: "Generate evidence report"

7. Claude: Provides formatted summary with sources
```

**Result:** Multi-source evidence synthesis instantly.

### **Workflow 3: Real-Time Research Session**

```
You're researching Peter Thiel's weather connections:

1. Drop PDF: palantir_annual_report.pdf
   Claude: "Found Palantir, Tomorrow.io mentioned 5x"

2. Ask: "Tell me about Tomorrow.io"
   Claude: "Weather intelligence company, satellite data..."

3. Drop CSV: infrastructure_actors.csv
   Claude: "Loaded, has Tomorrow.io + Palantir entries"

4. Ask: "Are they connected?"
   Claude: "Yes! Palantir-Tomorrow.io partnership July 2025"

5. Drop: thiel_investments.pdf
   Claude: "Thiel founded Palantir, backed Rainmaker..."

6. Ask: "Map the complete network"
   Claude: "Thiel → Palantir → Tomorrow.io → Weather Data
            Thiel → Rainmaker → Cloud Seeding → Weather Mod"

7. You: "Export this network"
```

**Result:** Live investigation with AI assistant.

- Progress bar shows status
- Don't close window while processing

**Image Quality:**
- Higher resolution = better OCR
- Clear text works best
- Handwriting: results vary
- Try pre-processing if poor results

### **Claude Queries:**

**Be Specific:**
- ❌ "Tell me about the data"
- ✅ "How many entities were found in DOD_contract.pdf?"

**Use Context:**
- ❌ "What about Raytheon?"
- ✅ "Does Raytheon appear in both the PDF and my Actors database?"

**Build On Responses:**
- Let Claude guide you
- Ask follow-up questions
- Request clarifications
- Dig deeper incrementally

### **Database Management:**

**CSV Loading:**
- Drop CSVs anytime
- They persist in browser memory
- Refresh = need to reload
- Use consistent column names

**Data Queries:**
- Claude can search loaded data
- Mention database names explicitly
- Ask for specific columns
- Request filtered results
