# COVID-19 PCR Testing & True Infection Rates: Comprehensive Research Library

**Investigation Purpose:** To systematically examine evidence from multiple methodologies to determine the relationship between PCR test positivity and actual SARS-CoV-2 infection rates.

**Truth-Seeking Approach:** We acknowledge that everyone involved in the pandemic—from public health officials to citizens—experienced trauma and made decisions under extreme uncertainty. This investigation seeks truth, not vindication. We examine ALL evidence fairly, including studies that support different conclusions.

**What I believe going into this:**
- [ ] PCR likely overcounted infections significantly
- [ ] PCR was reasonably accurate
- [ ] I genuinely don't know yet

**What would change my mind:**
- [ ] [List specific evidence that would shift your view]

**What I'm afraid to find:**
- [ ] [Honest acknowledgment of emotional stakes]

## **FINAL SYNTHESIS QUESTIONS**

After completing all reviews:

1. **What is the weight of evidence?**
2. **Where is there genuine scientific disagreement?**
3. **What key questions remain unanswered?**
4. **What would the IDEAL study look like?**
5. **How should we update our understanding of pandemic response?**
6. **What do we owe to all parties who suffered—those who felt over-restricted AND those who lost loved ones?**

**Remember:** Truth-seeking means being willing to be wrong. It means acknowledging that public health officials, scientists, politicians, and citizens ALL made decisions under extreme uncertainty with imperfect information. The goal isn't to "win"—it's to learn what actually happened so we can do better next time.
